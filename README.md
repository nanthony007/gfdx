# GFDX 

## Intro
This project has three main components.  

1. The web app
2. The data app
3. The notebooks

### The web app
(currently on hold)

This application is written in Python using Streamlit as a web base due to its simplicty.  This app serves as a web-based entrypoint to automate and manually run analysis.

### The data app
(under active development)

This application is written in Python and aims to standardize and structure the GFDX data source.

### The notebooks
(under active development)

These notebooks are written in Python and serve as the foundation for the entire application.  The notebooks contain the analysis code with comments and explanations.  The code here is meant to be as simple as possible while achieving the desired outcomes and thus notebooks should contain Markdown and visualizatinos to improve communicability.

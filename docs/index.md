# Welcome to the GFDx Analysis Automation


This document’s purpose is to provide a high-level overview of 
the GFDx automation program, where it can be found, how to add 
analysis to the automation, and relevant contact information 
for the people involved.

## Project Location
This project can be found [here](https://gfdx-automation.herokuapp.com)

## Project Actions
This project runs a series of analysis each night.

The analysis will run automatically every night at 1:30 AM EST.

If you wish to run the analysis manually you can click the “Run Analysis” button on the website.

***Be cautious this can take some time.*

A new analysis can be added by contacting Nick (see below).

The steps for adding new analysis are:
- Build the analysis in a jupyter notebook or similar environment
- Add documentation and explanations to your analysis
- Verify your analysis works as intended
- Send and communicate analysis to Nick and he will add to the automation by converting it to a python script
